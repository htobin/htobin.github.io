This was my second project from ics 111. We were just getting into collision as well as inserting sounds and objects with conditional statements. This game had the premise of pretty much any zombie game, you had a character which you moved around a screen and was able to pick up crates that spawned after a certain period of time. These crates would give you a chance to lay down barbed wire which would slow the zombies down, unfortunately this does not kill the zombie(because you need to take their head off, duh!) The zombies would spawn every few seconds, and eventually the player would be eaten.

This project was the second project, and was the first time I spend the whole day in the computer lab doing my work. My biggest issue was that I didn't know what a nested for loop was and therefore didn't have any idea on how to make collision points for my zombies/ the player. We used the EZ java library which simplified things to the point where images could be inserted easily, as well as sounds, and creating the background. Not only that but the EZ library also had a way to intialize a window easily. This made it quite easy to make a simple game that involved collision with multiple objects.

The craziest part about this assignment was that on the last day when the project was due, somehow when there were multiple zombies, multiple barbed wires wouldn't work if it wasn't the first one. I had stayed up till four in the morning hoping that I could figure out the issue. It turned out all I needed to do was add one more line of code before the zombie sequence which allowed later spawning zombies to be hit by more than one barbed wire. I still haven't looked at the code yet to see what actually happened, but as with most programmers. "My code doesn't work and I don't know why", and "My code works and I don't know why". This whole experience led me to love computer science even more, if you put in the time. Sometimes it doesn't work, but that's what makes coding frustrating/fun. That "aha" moment is something special.
