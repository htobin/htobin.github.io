  This project was my first team collaboration I experienced in programming. In fact, half of the group only started coding that semester. So this would be a learning experience with all of us. The game has the premise in which a character walks acorss the stage and all of a sudden a dragon drops down from the sky and they begin a fighting sequence. The character "Kevin" has a 2 actions that help him throughout the battle where he fights "Dale" the dragon. These actions are heal and attack. Heal gives bck health points, while attack uses sets off a bullet animation which at the end of it damages the dragon. The dragon shoots fireballs which removes either 10 or 5 health points depending on a random number generator.
   My portion of the project was fairly small. I was in charge of the text boxes as well as the background of the project, along with the text inside of the boxes. Originally we wanted to have two different backgrounds. One for the walking phase and one for and another for the battle phase. There was also the idea to have rolling text in the text box that was above. It would have been interesting to see an interaction between Kevin and Dale. Unfortunately we never got around to make them due to my inept programming experience and the short time limit.
   This team project was the first time I had put extensive hours into coding. The fact that there were multiple people on this project added an extra challenge to it. On the same coin though having people who were much more experienced in coding to assist, and overall make the project that much better. Another challenge was using the EZ java library that was given for us to use during the semester. Normally when doing a random project in java you can always reference someones work to do a project. Althought the ez library made it easy to bring in sounds and images in it. It didn't really help change the background very well, and also when it came to resetting our characters position for the background change. So we simply ditched the idea and just had the character walk across the screen to intiate the appearance of the dragon.
   This was my first experience in just how difficult programming could have been but I couldn't have asked for better teamates and overall a wonderful experience. I've been in multiple sports teams and groups throughout my life. But this is the first time where I had no idea what was going on, and really had to trust my teamates to do the best they could, and allow me to learn from them and my mistakes. 10/10 would work with this group again.
