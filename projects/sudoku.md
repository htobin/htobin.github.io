This is a sample of some of the cirriculum we had last semester in ics 211. The point of the assignment was to create a recursive sudoku puzzle solver. This was under the assumption that all sudoku puzzles were solvable. We were given premade puzzles that were confirmed to be solvable. We were also given the checks for determining whether the row, columb, or 3 x 3 box had the number that was being determined.
