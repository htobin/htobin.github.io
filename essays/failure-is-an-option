<p>
&emsp;
This past thursday was our first official WOD for my ics 314 class. I was fairly confident that I would do well. I did well in the practice
WODs, but I guess I should have done them a few more times. Because every WOD I practiced on I would always get some sort of syntax error.
For example when we did the problem
</br>
```
Create a function that converts a number from Farenheit to Celsius.
It was something similar to this
</br>
function changeTemp(tempType,Temp){ // function that takes in the paramaters of type being taken in, and the degree of tempurature
</br>
let finalTemp = 0; // initialize final temp
</br>
&emsp;if(tempType=="f"){
</br>
&emsp; &emsp; finalTemp= (Temp)(9/5)-32}
</br>
&emsp;if(tempType=="c"){
</br>
&emsp;&emsp; finalTemp= (Temp)(5/9)-32}
</br>
&emsp;else{
&emsp;&emsp; return "incorrect input"}
</br>
return finalTemp;}
</br>
console.log("f",212); // should come out to 100

}


```
