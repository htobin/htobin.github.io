  Ever since I was little, I remember always wanting see how things worked. Vaccum cleaners, cars, and most importantly toys. It was interesting to see how things worked, but that was just the "what". The "how" was always interesting, it wasn't until I was in high school in which I learned how a computer functioned. All my life I had slowly learned how to work around a computer, getting into the wireless settings in order to see what was wrong with the wireless network. To finding the optimal settings in order to play a video game. But I never really gave any thought what gave a computer life.Thanks to a few wonderful opportunities I was learning about the hardware such as a processor, graphics card, and motherboard. And even the software, and at one point I had a computer that was running ubuntu. Unfortunately I never really got into using my computer, my priorities had shifted towards sports and marine science. I simply wanted to play soccer and swim with fish all day.

    It's interesting to see where life takes you.<a href="https://htobin.github.io/essays/2018-01-17.html"> (read more about my journey into computer science)</a>, I went from wanting to study fish and play soccer, to staring at a computer screen for three days wanting my code to word. I'm currently in computer science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in my second year for the major. I'm still figuring out what I would like to do, but I'm leaning towards going into wireless networking or development in the "internet of things" field. I would like to get more fimiliar with how apps are developed, or even how to design a website that I can showcase my work, and hopefully by the end of the semester I start on some sort of project that is outside of class. I'm just not sure where to start as I don't really know any simple real life examples to fall back on. I'm hoping to find inspiration before my senior year which is coming up quick.
