 &emsp; The first time I attempted to do web design was for a Computer Science class in Hilo. It was tragedy. It's not that it makes me sad thinking about the class. It was just a sad attempt to find a filler class that was easy and required little to no work. Little did I know, the final project would actually involve me developing a website that I could eventually build upon. All I had to do was choose something that interested me. I ended up just using my friends website and passing with a C.

&emsp;Fast forward to these past two weeks and although it was difficult I didn't feel like a caveman learning how to make fire for the first time.. For example back in Hilo we used notepad++ to help develop our website. This time I was using a full blown IDE with IntelliJ.IntelliJ was less obtrusive when it came to having errors in the code, or more importantly on how the code should be styled. A cool feature that I picked up was learning how to have my code format itself by using the "ctrl+alt+ lower case L" hotkey, which made it easy to make sure all my divs were indented correctly, which after these past two WODS in particular were quite a lot. When also comparing my experience in Hilo, I didn't use a framework such as Semantic UI which was INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. If you've never coded before and are interested in getting experience with it, I think semantic UI makes it pretty easy to develop your own website. For example we did some mockups of web pages that we had seen, and the page I chose was from my friend Kamaka Pili. Who not only has his own line of malo, but also has Hawaiian culture inspired jewlrey and even his own show on KHON 2 called <a href="http://www.alohaauthentic.org/home.html">Aloha Authentic</a>. 
  Check it out his main website <a href="https://www.kamakapili.com/">Here</a>.

 &emsp; Back to coding. I had chosen a page on his website that was fairly easy to mock up. It didn't have too many pictures, and for the most part it was a picture with some words and rows of links. It had a navigation menu as well as a footer, as most websites do. It's interesting to note that the framework he used is called <a href="https://www.shopify.com/free-trial?term=shopify&Network=Search&SiteTarget=&mt=e&adid=216105201044&adpos=1t1&CampaignId=788843419&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAiAlL_UBRBoEiwAXKgW5-rUTRgJDFFiEuaaGzI53bBZLgl8gmZ4881wQWnJwfznB2YgKINHJBoC6ywQAvD_BwE"> Shopify</a> This framework was developed so that way people who wanted to start their own business didn't have time and/or the background to make their own website. I mean after all, if you don't have a website for your store you're missing out on lots of customers. A lot of the styles were defined as shopify styles with their own css files that they would refer to. But by using the google developer tool, finding different fonts and sizes was fairly easy. I'm also curious to see how the shopify framework operates and if it uses it's own online IDE. That would definitely help explain why it's such as success at creating simple shoppable websites.

 &emsp;  Semantic UI made it easy to create the navigation bar, footer, and have all my links, pictures, and paragraphs in centered rows.. I could only imagine how past me would have made that website much more quickly with Semantic if I had known about it back then. Using raw html and css seems so primative now. It's like trying to start a fire with sticks rather than using the lighter and lighter fluid next to you. I'm sure there's an art to HTML and CSS coding, and I'm not deep enough into programming to where I actually understand what's going on, but I can certainly respect it. It's like people's love for country music. I don't understand it, but I can respect their love for the genre.
